/**
 * Pure-logic policy: how long an idle hobby must wait after it fails.
 *
 * <p>No Minecraft imports — this is decision arithmetic over ints/longs/strings only.
 *
 * <p><b>The storm this exists to prevent.</b> The idle-hobby scheduler's wooden fallback used a
 * single flat 12 s cooldown. A hobby that fails <em>deterministically</em> — "I have no axe and
 * can't make or find one", where the skill exits inside one server tick without changing anything
 * — therefore restarted every 12 s at best, and, whenever the cooldown was wiped by an unrelated
 * gate, on every second tick. The 2026-09-06 field log caught exactly that: 197 identical
 * "Idle hobby 'woodcut' finished … success=false" lines at 3–19 per second across two bursts.
 * A flat cooldown cannot tell "try again in a moment, the world may have changed" apart from
 * "this will fail identically forever", so this policy grows the wait with each consecutive
 * failure until a bot that genuinely cannot do a hobby retries it at a human pace instead of a
 * tick-rate one.
 *
 * <p><b>Counting convention.</b> {@link Attempt#consecutiveFailures()} is the number of failures
 * recorded <em>before</em> the attempt being described — so the first failure of a fresh hobby
 * carries {@code consecutiveFailures == 0} and earns exactly {@link #BASE_FAILURE_TICKS}. Call
 * sites read the stored counter, build the {@link Attempt} with it, then fold the outcome in with
 * {@link #nextFailureCount(int, boolean)}.
 *
 * <p><b>Aborts are not failures.</b> A run that ended because the user cancelled it
 * ({@code /bot stop}, a threat pause) says nothing about whether the hobby is viable, so it
 * neither adds backoff nor advances the counter.
